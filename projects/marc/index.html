                MARC-1 is an innovative smart plug designed to help you monitor and control your power consumption, all from the convenience of your smartphone. It is designed to seamlessly integrate into your home, while still speaking a strong design language. The Webinterface provides you with real-time data on your energy usage, as well as the ability to remotely control connected devices. Whether you're looking to reduce your carbon footprint, save on energy costs, or simply have greater control over your home's electricity usage, MARC-1 is the perfect solution.

            <div class="text">
                One of the key technical features of MARC-1 is its use of LoRaWAN technology. This wireless communication protocol enables the smart plug to connect with the main server even in areas where WiFi access is limited or unavailable, making it a practical solution for users who want to use MARC-1 in remote areas. In addition, LoRaWAN technology provides a hassle-free plug-and-play experience, ensuring that users can quickly and easily set up MARC-1 and begin monitoring and controlling their energy consumption.

            <div class="text">
                MARC 1 was the graduation project of three friends and me at HTL. I was responsible for the entire Hardware, including the product design and all internal electronics. My design approch started with setting boundries such as a footprint of 5.5cm x 5.5cm and a switchable current of 16A. I then experimented with the external design in Blender. Once I was satisfied with the looks I started modelling the internal supporting structure in Fusion 360 and ultimately 3D-prinitng it for assembly.
